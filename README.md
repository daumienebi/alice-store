# Alice Store

Simple project to simulate a Shopping App where users can view products, add products to wishlist, handle cart items,search for products etc..

The app is part of a friend's final project of a Screen printing course. I decided to take on this task to broaden my knowledge and
get to work with Firebase and polish my flutter skills.

Note : The app is not meant to be a real-world shopping app, it might be be taken down from the Playstore after the project is presented but
the APK will be available here with the source code.

## Todo : Explain how to config for Firebase, the products server etc.
