# A L I C E S T O R E / Json_Server
Json server with a wanna be a API to serve the store

The idea is to use the json_server stuff to setup a simple api and host it later on Heroku with NodeJs.

- `npm run server` to run the server on localhost:3000. To access it from the android emulator or physical device,
    `localhost` needs to be swapped with your `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS`
